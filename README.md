Starting your Reader's Digest Django Project
In your terminal, go to your workspace directory.
Create a new directory called readers-digest.
cd to that directory.
You are going to run a script that prompts you for a word for your project. When it prompts you, enter the word digest.

Once the process completes, run pipenv shell to activate the virtual environment that was created for your project.
Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
